# Smart Text Editor For Sign Language Users Using Computer Vision

Our "Smart Text Editor for Sign Language Users Using Computer Vision" project is all about making communication easier for people who use sign language. Sign language is a great way for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to express themselves, but it can be challenging when it comes to written communication.

We've created a smart text editor using computer vision, specifically with the OpenCV library. This editor allows users to translate their sign language gestures into written text on a computer. By using a webcam and a user-friendly interface made with Tkinter, our application provides an easy and accessible solution for those who rely on sign language to communicate in writing.
